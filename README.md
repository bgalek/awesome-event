### Venue

* ensure stable network connection
	* if wireless - it's a good idea to have 2 of them (for speakers and audiences)
* red dot / tape the floor for speaker to know where to stand
* prepare a feedback screen for speaker to see notes/slides
	* or at least prepare a clock for speakers to see

### Hardware

* setup microphones and test sound before the event

### Slides rules

Please provide informations to speakers about slides format i.e. resolution, color scheme, 
sound availability, file format etc.  and how to deliver it to organizers.

### Procurement

Using SAP? 
Remember to add vendors beforehand before you issue any Purchase Order.

### Journalist

* ask or hire somebody to photograp the event, give this person some time to prepare
* notes, photos and movies from the event are good material for your event history webpage

### Breaks
Remember that your audience needs regular breaks - they will be tired and won't be able to focus on presentations even after 90 minutes of continuous active listening.
The break will also be useful for people actively working at the event.

Short breaks
Provide at least 10 min breaks, so that everyone has time for drink and go to the bathroom.
If your event is held in more than one room, attendees must also have time space to move to the room that interests them.

Long breaks
Provide at least one long break during the day that can be used for lunch and rest.

If possible, provide participants with the option of going outside to fresh air during breaks.
